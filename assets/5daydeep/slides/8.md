# Day 02: Neural networks using the GPU, PyCUDA, PyTorch and Matlab:

- This intensive session will discuss CUDA, GPU based tensors and Python acceleration.  PyTorch supports GPU tensors natively and using PyCUDA, one can run any CUDA code on the GPU. Matlab has native CUDA generation support.
Most developers are aware that some algorithms can be run on a GPU, instead of a CPU, and see orders of magnitude speedups. However, many people assume that: Only specialist areas like deep learning are suitable for GPU and Learning to program a GPU takes years of developing specialist knowledge
- It turns out that neither assumption is true! Nearly any non-recursive algorithm that operates on datasets of 1000+ items can be accelerated by a GPU. And recent libraries like PyTorch/PyCUDA/Matlab make it nearly as simple to write a GPU accelerated algorithm as a regular CPU algorithm.
