# Day 04: Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras

- In this session, you will use CNNâ€™s to compete in an active Kaggle competition. Each and every step would be explained in detail.
- This hands-on session will take you from 0 to 100 in Deep Learning with Keras.
Our aim is to teach the fundamentals of deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks `(CNN)`
based on modern techniques using the Keras API and the Tensorflow backend.
By the end participants will know how to build deep learning models, how to train them,
what to avoid during training, what to check during training and how to perform model inference,
especially for image based problems.
