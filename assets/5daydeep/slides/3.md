# Background

Deep Learning Bootcamp is an intensive 5-day program intended to teach you about deep learning.
The Bootcamp is organized such that it amalgamates, “Theory” and “Practice” –
identifying that a deep learning scientist desires a survey of concepts combined with a
strong application of practical techniques through labs.
```
% reset -f
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, log_loss, roc_auc_score, roc_curve, auc
from sklearn.cross_validation import StratifiedKFold, ShuffleSplit, cross_val_score, train_test_split
```
Primarily, the foundational material and tools of the Data Science practitioner
are presented via Sk-Learn. Topics continue rapidly into exploratory data analysis and
classical machine learning, where the data is organized, characterized, and manipulated.

From day two, the students move from engineered models into 4 days of Deep Learning.
```
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3)
```
