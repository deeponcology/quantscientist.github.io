# Target Audience and Prerequisites:

### Prereqs & Preparation

- Experience in `Python programming is a must`, basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.
- We also assume `BASIC` familiarity with neural networks at the level of an intro AI class (such as one from the Russel and Norvig book).
- Any prior knowledge in Deep Learning is a big plus, but an interest is a must!
